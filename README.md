# CV-Elevator
Elevator powered by Computer Vision (CV) Technology (Prototype)
## What is this?
In order to fully comprehend the shear confusion of this repo, I want to talk about the TechGenius Competition 2021 organized by RMIT University. In the competition, a team consisted of 3 members are given around 2-3 months to come up with a technological solution for the COVID19 pandemic, and our team decided to develop an elevator system that can be controlled without direct contact with the buttons to minimize viral transmission as much as possible. With that being said, this repo contains all of our project files, which are not that many.  
## Required frameworks / libraries:
OpenCV, MediaPipe, PySerial along with other peripherals.
